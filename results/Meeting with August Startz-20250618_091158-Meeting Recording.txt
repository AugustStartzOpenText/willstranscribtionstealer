First and foremost, I want the record to show I spent the last 20 minutes troubleshooting
a problem simply because my mic was muted.
So I actually had this working like a half hour ago, but didn't realize my mic was muted,
so the transcription just kept coming back blank, and I thought it was a problem with
the program.
I should have known this was impossible.
How could there be a problem with something August created?
This is like an impossibility.
It's kind of like one of those things, is there ever a sound so loud that no one can
hear it?
It's impossible.
This is a brain teaser.
How could August make a mistake?
And even in the fact that my headset was muted, it was not August's mistake.
Whoever created the piece of junk headset I am using.
That probably came free with a PS5 for a 12 year old to play Warzone in, made the mute
button too large, and my sausage fingers accidentally pressed it, muting myself.
Which is a loss for all of humanity, as the greatness of August was stifled.
I think this has gone on long enough.
We're at 90 seconds now, I mean, how much more are you going to listen to me babble?
Or my apologies.
Read.
Read.
A transcription of me babbling.
